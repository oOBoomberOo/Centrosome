Oxidized Centrosome is a fork of "Centrosome by Cocoon" rewritten in Rust. (Yes, I know, Oxidized Centrosome make no sense)

Oxidized Centrosome is a command-line tool that provide automatic datapack merging with a simple command with amazing speed.

## Getting Started
1) Run command `centrosome <directory>` where `<directory>` is the directory that you put your datapacks inside.
2) You will be asked to choose a "Core Datapack". This pack will have higher priority than other pack and will prefer to override other file in case of conflict.
3) ???
4) Profit!
